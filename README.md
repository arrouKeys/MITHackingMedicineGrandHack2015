## MITGrandHack2015

**2015 MIT Hacking Medicine GrandHack | 24 - 26 April 2015 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology**

Competed with approximately 400+ developers, physicians, engineers, and other students and professionals in a global hacking competition at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Competed in the Telehealth Track with the goal of transforming care pathways and patient health management through the use of remote technologies. Won 3rd place at the Grand Hack Finale.

The product from this weekend is an Android app that performs patient geotracking; the app notifies the appropriate contacts with relevant patient and hospital information when the patient is readmitted to a hospital for emergency care. All work was done in Android Studio and Eclipse, written in Java, and also utilized several Google, Android, and Microsoft Band APIs.
