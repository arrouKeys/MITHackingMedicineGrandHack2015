# MITGrandHack2015

Project from MIT Hacking Medicine event (24 - 26 April 2015, Massachusetts Institute of Technology). Built in Android Studio using Google Play Services API and Microsoft Band Preview SDK.

*Group Members: Akshara, Brianna, Kyan, Michael, Robert, Robert.*

Competed with approximately 400 developers, physicians, engineers, and others in a global hacking competition at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), April 24 - 26. Competed in the Telehealth Track with the goal of transforming care pathways and patient health management through the use of remote technologies.

The product from the weekend is an Android app that performs patient geotracking; the app notifies the appropriate contacts with relevant patient and hospital information when the patient is readmitted to a hospital for emergency care. All work was done in Android Studio and Eclipse using Java, and also utilized several Google, Android, and Microsoft Band APIs.
